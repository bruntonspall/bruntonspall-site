<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 4th through November 5th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/3889970">You're Missing the Point of Promises</a> - What&#039;s important about a Promise is not that allows defered operation for the success or failure of an asynchronous task (although it does), it&#039;s that it allows composition of promises.  That you can pass promises into functions, and if the original function returns an error, the function operations all collapse into the appropriate error handling states.</li>
<li><a href="http://jsforcats.com/">JavaScript for Cats</a> - Javascript is one of the languages that I recommend to new programmers, not because it&#039;s a particularly nice programming language, but because your browser contains the javascript console, and you can use it to great effect almost immediately, so the learning curve feels lower.  This tutorial starts you off with opening the console on the page, so plays to it&#039;s strengths.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2012/nov/02/functional-programming-scala-the-final-push">Functional Programming Principles in Scala: the final push | guardian.co.uk</a> - Our department continues to work through the Functional programming principles course from Martin Odersky, something I&#039;ve personally found tricky in places because I struggle with some of the more abstract problems.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/responsive-wordpress-bootstrap-theme-tutorial">How to Build a Responsive WordPress Theme with Bootstrap</a> - There&#039;s a reason that Wordpress is one of the most popular blogging engines around, and the ease of creating a new theme is part of that.<br />
Bootstrap is fast becoming the defacto web interface for developers with minimal to low design skills.<br />
These technologies help you get the job done faster and with less thinking about details.  That&#039;s pragmatism right there</li>
<li><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/03/03/nobody-wants-to-learn-how-to-program/">Nobody Wants to Learn How to Program</a> - An interesting view on how we teach concepts far too early in programming courses.  People want to program for a reason, not for the joy of programming itself.  Those concepts are important, but at an appropriate level, let people have fun programming for a purpose first.</li>
</ul>
