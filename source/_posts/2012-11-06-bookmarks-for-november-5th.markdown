<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 5th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506326/the-technology-of-massive-open-online-courses/">Daphne Koller, the AI Researcher Who Founded Coursera</a> - The background behind coursera is fascinating.  In my opinion it&#039;s one of the best presented MOOC&#039;s, and the range of courses is fantastic.  It grows from strength to strength as each new course starts, and I&#039;m looking forward to seeing how they can expand and monetise it in the future.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/deadlines-and-disruption-my-turbulent-path-from-print-to-digital-by-stephen-b-shepard/2012/11/02/cc08db12-0d65-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html">&ldquo;Deadlines and Disruption: My Turbulent Path From Print to Digital&rdquo; by Stephen B. Shepard - The Washington Post</a> - When even an editor of major print publications starts running journalism courses that focus on digital you know the world has changed.  We&#039;re just waiting for everyone to catch up now.</li>
<li><a href="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/10/09/stop-attacking-web-first-as-if-the-world-is-going-to-stand-still/">Stop attacking &lsquo;web-first&rsquo; as if the world is going to stand still</a> - Paul Bradshaw being as insightful as always, wants to remind paper media that it&#039;s not always about &quot;Content&quot; or &quot;Ads&quot;, and waiting for online ad revenue to equal paper ad revenue means missing the real opportunities that the web brings.</li>
</ul>
