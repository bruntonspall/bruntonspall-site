<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 6th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://john.onolan.org/ghost/">Ghost - John O'Nolan</a> - The best products are about taking something complex and taking something away, in fact taking away everything that isn&#039;t about a single core vision.  This project looks like it will be interesting</li>
<li><a href="http://rsmith.co/2012/11/05/mongodb-gotchas-and-how-to-avoid-them/">MongoDB Gotchas &amp; How To Avoid Them</a> - MongoDB has gotten a bit of a bad rap over time, partly because lists like this have to exist.  But then a lot of the haters hate it because it&#039;s default behaviour if you don&#039;t read the manual can bite you, and I have no sympathy for people who don&#039;t read the manual</li>
</ul>
