<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 8th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/11/html5-mythbusting/">HTML5 mythbusting</a> - Chris Heilmann covers some of the more common myths about HTML5 as a mobile app development platform.</li>
<li><a href="http://shopify.github.com/dashing/">Dashing - A lovely dashboard system</a> - This looks very pretty.  A lot of our dashboards tend towards the ugly and it always bothers me that we don&#039;t seem to have time to make them pretty.  I love that this is pretty, but I&#039;d need to use it in anger to know it&#039;s usefulness</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/11/08/world-of-warcraft-still-has-10-million-subscribers/">World Of Warcraft STILL Has 10 Million Subscribers!</a> - Some lovely sanity here from RPS. Having millions of subscribers is a success not a failure. This same thing can be said of AOL, Facebook, Twitter and other sites that pundits declare dead when early adopters move on tto something newer and shinier.</li>
<li><a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/11/08/digital-strategy-as-a-website/">Publishing the Digital Strategy as a website, rather than on one</a> - I&#039;m firmly of the view that git and markdown is the future of text based publishing. Markdown is so simple to use and supports 99% of use cases. I&#039;d start any cms project today with a Markdown editor first.</li>
<li><a href="http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/07/inside-the-secret-world-of-quants-and-data-crunchers-who-helped-obama-win/print/">Obama Wins: How Chicago's Data-Driven Campaign Triumphed</a> - Even political campaigns are starting to make data driven decisions. Is your organisation doing the same thing? Are you?</li>
</ul>
