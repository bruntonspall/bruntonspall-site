<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 8th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/misc/100_things_the_guardian_cares_about_in_decreasing_order.html">The top 100 things the guardian is interested in</a> - Matt does some amazing data analysis work, and here he&#039;s looked at all of the articles the guardian has published and then worked out the topics of interest</li>
<li><a href="http://www.haystacksoftware.com/blog/2012/11/arq-cloud-backup-for-mac-adds-support-for-amazon-glacier/">Arq (Cloud Backup for Mac) Adds Support for Amazon Glacier</a> - Arq is a nice backup tool, and this just makes it better.  Glacier support means you can pay around $1 per month for 100G.  Retrieval can be expensive, but then most of the time you only want to retrieve offsite backups if your onsite backups are dead, which shouldn&#039;t happen often.</li>
</ul>
