<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 8th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/116171619992010691739/posts/gcXURKLN8bg">(experimental) Web Intents pulled from Chrome</a> - I&#039;ve not been following Web Intents closely enough to understand why this is, but this seems a shame.  Intents is one of the most powerful features of Android, and I was loving seeing the team working on attempting to bring some of those ideas to the Web.  It was however always marked as experimental, so it&#039;s good that if it&#039;s not working, Google feel they can pull it.  Fail fast and all that.</li>
<li><a href="http://newsosaur.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/newspapers-failing-to-diversify-digital.html">Newspapers failing to diversify digital audience</a> - This has an interesting viewpoint on Newspapers.  I still think that the problem here is not that Newspapers don&#039;t leverage social networks well, it&#039;s that while they still think of themselves as newspapers rather than media aggregators they&#039;ll never change their fundamental approach.</li>
</ul>
