<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 9th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CodeBetter/~3/C6M8f65VvaA/">Versioning RESTful Services</a> - How are you versioning your API&#039;s? Just changing the data structures? Adding v2 or v3 to the urls? With accept headers?  This article pretty clearly demonstrates some of the possibilities, and simultaneously makes one of the best arguments for &quot;Hypermedia&quot; that I&#039;ve seen.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/10/google-spanner">Google Publishes Paper On Spanner Ushering a Return to Distributed Transactional Semantics</a> - Are you reading academic research within your field?  I&#039;ve found it hard to keep track of this stuff as I was not academically trained so don&#039;t really know where to look, but Google, Yahoo and Microsoft have great research arms that publish a lot of interesting papers and things like Spanner can help you think about multi-datacenter, multi-region applications, and just how complex they could be.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/09/useful-tech-talks-videos-web-conferences/">Useful Tech Talks And Videos From Web Conferences</a> - A brilliant list of videos that probably exceeds 100 hours of content from the best, from Jeremy Keith to Jeff Atwood; from Gruber to Pilgrim; from Inayaili De Leon to David McCandless.  Getting this amount of time with these amazing people would have cost you thousands of pounds and hundreds of hours this year.</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/xb5LLOO4_2c/">Airbnb: Our Guests Stay Longer And Spend More Than Hotel Guests, Contributing $56M To The San Francisco Economy</a> - AirBnB is a great company, but this PR release feels like more of a failure to understand the limitations of averages than anything of real value.  The &quot;Average&quot; AirBnB user spends more per stay than the &quot;average&quot; hotel guest, but without knowing the std deveavtion, percentiles and other stats that number is meaningless.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2012/11/guardian-comment-system-changes.php">Guardian comment system changes: The perils of designing for all users, not just the vocal ones</a> - </li>
