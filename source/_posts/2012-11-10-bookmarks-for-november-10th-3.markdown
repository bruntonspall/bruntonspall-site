<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 10th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.golang.org/2012/11/go-turns-three.html">The Go Programming Language Blog: Go turns three</a> - The Go language has turned three years old and is stabilising into a pretty interesting language. My biggest problem is that it doesn&#039;t solve any of my problems, but if I was still writing high performance c and c++ apps, I&#039;d be taking a good hard look at it.</li>
<li><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/20-all-too-common-coding-pitfalls-for-beginners/">20 All Too Common Coding Pitfalls For Beginners</a> - I find this one a bit divisive, I wouldn&#039;t agree with all of these in all situations, but as a beginner programmer most of these tips are petty good. Most of the JavaScript ones could be replaced with the advice to use CoffeeScript instead though :-)</li>
</ul>
