<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 10th through November 11th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paymill.com/en-gb/">Paymill</a> - We&#039;ve all been waiting for Stripe to roll out to Europe for a while now, as it would be a real competitor to PayPal.  The european payments market is dominated by Merchant Accounts complex application processes and of course Paypal.  If Paymill&#039;s promise is true, it would make for a option for startups doing the MVP thing, fast integration for payments is invaluable.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2012/11/10/the-bbc-in-crisis-a-problem-of-confidence-not-trust/">George Entwistle is gone but how to rebuild confidence in the BBC?</a> - Charlie Beckett does a brilliant summary of the BBC fiasco that lead to the director general stepping down.  This is a relatively complex subject, and isn&#039;t the result of pressure from outside the BBC, but a direct result of the failure of a flagship journalistic show to do basic journalistic checks, and a management structure that was wilfully unaware, and allowed a program to go out without the required checks and balances.</li>
</ul>
