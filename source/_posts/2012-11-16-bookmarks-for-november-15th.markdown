<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 15th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/11/15/media-companies-better-embrace-project-glass-because-its-going-to-change-everything/">Media companies: Embrace Project Glass, it&rsquo;s going to change everything &mdash; Tech News and Analysis</a> - Will Google Glass change everything? I&#039;m not sure how good a product it will eventually be (Google have got this stuff more wrong than right in the past), but the concepts it prepares us for? Those will change everything.</li>
<li><a href="http://pocket.co/shaP5">Web App Mistakes: Condemned to repeat</a> - Interesting summary of some of the challenges with the webapps vs web debate. I&#039;m not sure I agree with the view on native apps.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/metro-announces-mobile-first-strategy-and-responsive-site/s2/a551190/">Metro announces 'mobile-first' strategy and responsive site</a> - So the Metro is going to move to WordPress for it&#039;s CMS.  This makes a lot of sense, because any time spent building a CMS is not time spent building tools for journalism.  Telling I think is the final paragraph.  Could your CMS team find the time to build an alerting dashboard that a story is going viral, or are they too busy building a CMS?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.glitch.com/closing/">A sad announcement from Tiny Speck (Glitch)</a> - Glitch was awesomely imaginative and creative and interesting. It sadly didn&#039;t attract enough customers to keep going.  But more importantly, if your startup fails (and most do), you need to work out how you are going to fail well.  The Glitch team have set the bar for closing announcements here.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/11/14/code-length-measured-in-14-languages/">Code Length Measured in 14 Languages</a> - Mathmatica can be used to solve problems in less cod. However I believe it is not about code conciseness (although that&#039;s important), but about clarity of intent.  I.e. a langauge should be as short as is readable, but no shorter.  Code golf can shows how conciseness can be achieved at the cost of readability.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.minming.net/post/35553963889/a-billion-dollar-software-tech-company-is-founded-every">A billion dollar software tech company is founded every 3 months *in U.S.</a> - Interesting list of startups that have been acquired or reported valuations of approx $1B. Ignoring the discussion around valuation vs actual worth, what I think is interesting here is that it&#039;s been a pretty consistent rate over time, and that I suspect that technology choices (language, libraries etc) made no appreciable difference to this list.  I suspect that PHP and Ruby have a strong showing here despite being &quot;Hacker languages&quot;</li>
</ul>
