<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 16th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pocket.co/shUz3">Kill the Password: Why a String of Characters Can&rsquo;t Protect Us Anymore</a> - This should be required reading for people building web services. Its not just how you secure your system, but are you allowing jigsaw identification of your users and what does your identity reset system need.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/pay-another-way-bitcoin/">Pay Another Way:&nbsp;Bitcoin &mdash; WordPress.com</a> - Another big internet operator starts accepting Bitcoins.  Interesting that despite some serious misgivings about the economies of Bitcoins, they are increasingly becoming the internet currency of note.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html">Why 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs' matters</a> - The SICP book is a legend in programming circles, and if you didn&#039;t study it at university (or didn&#039;t go to university) then I recommend taking a long run up and giving it a whirl.  It works great as a companion to the recent Functional Programming in Scala course</li>
</ul>
