<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 16th through November 17th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/dont-call-it-a-redesign/265317/">Don't Call It a Redesign - Bob Cohn - The Atlantic</a> - Another news site, another rebuild of the navigation experience, and another slew of commenters saying how much they hate it.  Some things never seem to change</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/nov/16/hyperlocalising-news-augmented-reality">Hyperlocalising news</a> - AR is taking off, and as the Google Glass project shows, there&#039;s a lot of interest in understanding it.  But are news organisations in on this? Will Perrin gives a great overview of some ideas on how AR can help make news more local</li>
<li><a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/helen-goodman-mp-is-particularly-stupid/">Helen Goodman MP is &ldquo;Particularly Stupid&rdquo; by Terence Eden</a> - This is a concern. In a political climate where ministerial portfolios are passed around, how can we be sure that the minister for internet affairs has at least a basic knowledge of computing.</li>
</ul>
