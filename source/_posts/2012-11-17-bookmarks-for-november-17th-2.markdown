<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 17th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rtaylor.co.uk/huppert-civil-liberties-ldconf.html">Julian Huppert's Fantastic Liberal Democrat Conference Motion on Civil Liberties</a> - This is the reason that I support my MP. I don&#039;t care what party he represents, since he&#039;s shown himself willing to disagree with the party, but his position on civil liberties and technology so mirrors my own.</li>
<li><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/35508225/0/scotthanselman~The-Internet-is-not-a-black-box-Look-inside.aspx">The Internet is not a black box. Look inside.</a> - There&#039;s a massive value to being able to look inside.  Smewhat ironically given Scott Handselman&#039;s area of expertise, this is one of the reasons that I like open source libraries.  The ability to look inside and see what is happening if you need to is so vital to becoming a good developer.</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/alistapart/main/~3/KEXq0iLPEYU/">Universal Design IRL</a> - What if you apply design to our real life communities? Sexism and Racism isn&#039;t always explicit, but protecting against them needs to be for an industry as undiverse as ours</li>
</ul>
