<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 17th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://strideapp.com/blog/2012/11/sending-morning-emails/">Sending morning emails</a> - This seems to make this far more complex than necessary, and relies on detecting a users timezone, which of course will only detect their current timezone. I tend to sign up for things in hotels at conferences because I have spare time then.  I appreciate the pragmatism of how to send emails for users for their monday morning though.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/11/ff-the-manuscript/all/">They Cracked This 250 Year-Old Code, And Found a Secret Society Inside</a> - Fascinating story about cryptoanalysis.  Just plain enjoyable.</li>
<li><a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/twitter-is-pivoting">Twitter is pivoting | Dalton Caldwell</a> - Interesting analysis of twitter&#039;s latest announcement.  Of course Dalton can hardly be said to be neutral in this discussion, and we&#039;ve yet to see what Chernin will bring to twitter, but as a normal twitter user it&#039;s probably not going to be good</li>
</ul>
