<li><a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/">Napster, Udacity, and the Academy by Clay Shirky</a> - Clay gives an insight into how he thinks that MOOC&#039;s like Udacity and Coursera are changing academia.</li>
<li><a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/the-perils-of-url-shortners/">The Perils of URL Shortners</a> - A reminder that many url shorteners, goo.gl and bit.ly included, allow anyone to view the stats.  You might not want that.</li>
