<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 21st through November 22nd:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/11/21/prince-william-photos-password/">Prince William photos accidentally reveal RAF password</a> - Disappointed to note that the advice in this column is to ensure that if you are photographed, you move any visible passwords. How about not printing usernames and passwords out and sticking them up?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/">Welcome to the new and improved, leaner and faster Engadget</a> - Another responsive design layout, another screed of comments from readers saying they hate it.</li>
<li><a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/20/the-last-day/">The last day</a> - A slightly sad reminder of what is most likely to face you if y start a startup.</li>
</ul>
