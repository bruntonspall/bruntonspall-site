<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 23rd</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://indiegames.com/2012/11/5_tips_for_using_procedurally-.html">IndieGames.com - The Weblog 5 tips for using procedurally-generated content in your game</a> - Procedural generation is much harder than just throwing a random number generator at the problem.  Some great highlights as to what sort of issues you might need to think through</li>
<li><a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/hackdays-how-much-preparation-is-acceptable/">Hackdays - How Much Preparation is Acceptable?</a> - Eden discusses some of the issues around hack days and preperation.  In a perfect world, people would start with a fresh slate at the start of the day, but once you start awarding significant prizes (not just a copy of Settlers of Catan for example), then of course the incentive is to prepare well in advance</li>
<li><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/11/22/gone-fishin-plentyoffish-architecture.html">Gone Fishin': PlentyOfFish Architecture</a> - Scaling out to thousands of parallel servers isn&#039;t the only way to scale, it is possible to Scale Up, increasing the size of your servers instead.  It might work out more expensive in some cases, but it&#039;s still worth considering</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2012/11/22/revenge-of-the-evil-empire-and-why-im-backing-darth-vader-my-case-against-statutory-newspaper-regulation-leveson/">Revenge of the Evil Empire and why I&rsquo;m backing Darth Vader: my case against statutory newspaper regulation #Leveson</a> - A great post by Charlie Beckett explaining just why he doesn&#039;t think that we should legally regulate newspapers.</li>
