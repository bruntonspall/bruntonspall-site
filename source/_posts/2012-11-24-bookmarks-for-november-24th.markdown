<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 24th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://t.co/DYTLC5sj">With any sophisticated system that can be learned, you will&hellip;</a> - Differentiating between power users and casual users can be really important when reading feedback. A great article attempting to explain where that difference comes from.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-suster-entrepreneur-2012-11">entrepreneurs need to be selfish and selfless - Business Insider</a> - An interesting view on some of the challanges of startup culture.</li>
<li><a href="http://deepvalue.net/ec2-is-380-more-expensive-than-internal-cluster/">EC2 costs 4 times higher than running internal cluster - (warning bad math)</a> - This kind of math irritates me. Sure a hard drive is cheaper than s3, but s3 isn&#039;t just a hard drive. Its machines to serve it, its multiple redundant devices and its variable cost versus fixed cost. Secondly aws means you aren&#039;t paying for engineers to maintain the equipment and deal with downtime, none of those costs are included here. Aws is more expensive than your own data centre, but that buys you flexibility</li>
</ul>
