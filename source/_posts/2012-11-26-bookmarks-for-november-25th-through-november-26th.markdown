<p>Things from around the web, as seen on November 25th through November 26th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://analyticsmadeskeezy.com/2012/11/05/check-yo-self-5-things-you-should-know-about-data-science-author-note/">5 Things You Should Know About Data Science &lt;- I like 4, Tools are wagging the analysts</a> - Data Science is a popular term right now, everyone seems to want to hire a data scientist, despite the fact that nobody seems to know what one really is.  My impression from Strata Conf last year is that this is a arena where big companies can make big bucks selling rebadged versions of their old data warehousing solutions.</li>
<li><a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/what-twitter-can-learn-from-app.nets-developer-incentive-program/">What Twitter Can Learn From App.net's Developer Incentive Program &lt;- e.g. Just say thanks</a> - Eden with yet another great piece.  Despite the begining bits of this entry talking about how App.Net sent him money, the important part here is the last line, they could at least say thank you.  That&#039;s what Google IO, Microsoft Mix and so forth are about.</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/5tv9vDBef9w/">Going For &ldquo;Pretty First&rdquo; Is Wrong: A Designer&rsquo;s Take On App Development</a> - A good little reminder that design isn&#039;t about how your product looks, but good design is about how the user uses your product.  Visual is just one part of design, the feel and use are just as important</li>
</ul>
