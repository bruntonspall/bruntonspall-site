<p>Things from around the web, as seen on December 2nd</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/">Learn programming by visualizing python execution</a> - This is some damn impressive I&#039;m speechless.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.empathybox.com/post/19126121307/scala-macros-oh-god-why">Scala Macros: &quot;Oh God Why?&quot; - Jay Kreps</a> - Yup, Scala is awesome, but there&#039;s a million boring things to do, and the very few of the people suggesting new things write software for money, where just working is far more important than writing perfect code</li>
<li><a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/12/01/why-c-is-not-back/">Why C++ Is Not &ldquo;Back&rdquo; &laquo; Making the Complex Simple</a> - C++ has had a great set of improvements, but I agree here, if you wouldn&#039;t have used it before, you probably shouldn&#039;t start now.  They are great improvements if you are already using it, but it&#039;s still almost never the solution to the problem you have (unless it is)</li>
</ul>
