<p>Things from around the web, as seen on December 6th through December 7th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/2012/12/05/schema-evolution-in-avro-protocol-buffers-thrift.html">Schema evolution in Avro, Protocol Buffers and Thrift &mdash; Martin Kleppmann&rsquo;s blog</a> - Thinking about how to evolve your API or Schema is important.  This is an interesting way to evaluate different protocols, to find out who easily they support different schema migrations.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/conf/2012-PLATEAU-Fuzzer/pub/html/fuzzer.html">Comparative Language Fuzz Testing</a> - Fascinating read.  If you simulate common programming errors, how effective are compilers and runtime checkers at detecting your mistakes and throwing an error?<br />
I&#039;d be interested if a follow on done on real code bases with unit tests would find the effectiveness of unit testing</li>
<li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/12/sophisticated-botnet-steals-more-than-47m-by-infecting-pcs-and-phones/">Hackers build automated social engineering to get around 2factor authentication</a> - Security is always an arms race, when we invent a more secure system, hackers will invent a new way to get round it. Two factor authentication isn&#039;t fool proof.  Interestingly, I suspect that many technically adept people would be caught by the social engineering part of this</li>
</ul>
