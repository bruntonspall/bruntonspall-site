<p>Things from around the web, as seen on January 13th through January 16th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kotaku.com/5975610/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code?post=56177550">The Exceptional Beauty of Doom 3's Source Code</a> - Code clarity is vitally important, and several of the notes stressed here are an important part of that.  Comments shouldn&#039;t repeat the code declaration, prefer const/final/val over mutable state and so forth.<br />
I also like that John Carmack took the time to respond as well, nice touch.</li>
<li><a href="http://lookrobot.co.uk/2013/01/14/the-panasonic-toughpad-press-conference/">The Panasonic Toughpad Press Conference</a> - Like most journalists everywhere, I am hungover. - Tech journalism with added truth.</li>
<li><a href="http://ploum.net/post/ghost-web">The Ghost Web</a> - A fictional supposition of the future of the web.  I&#039;m not sure I agree with it all, generally users don&#039;t update that often, companies don&#039;t install firefox on their workstations, and of course by the end of 2013 I suspect that mobile usage of webkit based browsers will be much higher.<br />
Interesting thoughts though.</li>
</ul>
