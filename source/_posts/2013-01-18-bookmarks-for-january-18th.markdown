<p>Things from around the web, as seen on January 18th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2013/01/how-to-redesign-your-app-without-pissing-everybody-off.html">How to Redesign Your App Without Pissing Everybody Off - Anil Dash</a> - &quot;It&#039;s not inevitable that every change on the web has to involve drama&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/6HVvYr9kqPU/the-future-of-programming.html">The future of programming</a> - An interesting read into where programming may be going.  I say may because I&#039;ve seen a lot claims of the &quot;end of the priesthood of the programmer&quot; but I&#039;ve yet to see it happen</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/PascalPrecht/wbb">WebBookBoilerplate</a> - A neat boilerplate project for writing books.  Just add markdown formatted content and you can build various ebook formats.</li>
</ul>
