<p>Things from around the web, as seen on January 18th through January 23rd:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://launchrock.com/">LaunchRock - Set up a "Launching Soon" page in minutes</a> - If you are thinking of doing a startup, knowing your market is an important part of that.  Creating a signup page lets you measure interest easily.</li>
<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/21/ipad-hack-statement-of-responsibility/">iPad Hack Statement Of Responsibility</a> - Regardless of whether you think that Weev&#039;s actions were right or wrong, this is a stirring response to what is perceived as an injustice in sentencing.  Our society needs to work out what hacking actually is, and how we can deal with it appropriately.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.oskarsson.nu/post/40196324612/the-twitter-stack">The Twitter stack</a> - A lovely overview of the Twitter JVM stack in terms of flexible architecture.  Some lovely features in here.  I&#039;d most be interested in a timeline of how the stack has evolved since the ruby on rails days and how they made each jump.</li>
</ul>
