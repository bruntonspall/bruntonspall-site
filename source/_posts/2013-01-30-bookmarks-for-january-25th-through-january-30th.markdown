<p>Things from around the web, as seen on January 25th through January 30th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/01/29/why-do-americans-hate-android-and-love-apple">Why Do Americans Hate Android And Love Apple? - ReadWrite</a> - A good description of exactly what irks android fan boys about apple fan boys.  It&#039;s obviously one sided, but raises some good points.</li>
<li><a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2013/01/27/drive-by-criticism-must-die/">Drive-by criticism must die</a> - A great critique by @codepo8 on what twitter has done to online criticism.  It&#039;s way too easy to be overly critical online, and restricting your criticism to 140 characters makes it even harder to understand any level of nuance.<br />
Remember, &quot;don&#039;t be a dick&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/01/23/OAuth">How to Think About OAuth - Tim Bray</a> - Some really good points here, especially about how to deal with the overreach of the spec, essentially by ignoring it. OAuth isn&#039;t a protocol that needs libraries with 100% spec compliance.</li>
</ul>
