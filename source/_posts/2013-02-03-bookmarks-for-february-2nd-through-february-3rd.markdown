<p>Things from around the web, as seen on February 2nd through February 3rd:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/01/stacks-get-hacked-the-inevitable-rise-of-data-warfare.html">Stacks get hacked: The inevitable rise of data warfare - O'Reilly Radar</a> - &quot;you realize that you can take a similar approach to misleading your competitor. You can make them think a less-effective campaign is outperforming a successful one. [...] which causes them to pay for customer acquisition in less-effective channels.&quot;<br />
Big data is here to stay, but we often blindly trust the data itself.  We&#039;re going to need to get this wrong a fair amount before we can start to get it right</li>
<li><a href="http://truthteller.washingtonpost.com/">TruthTeller | The Washington Post</a> - This is a lovely idea, if flawed in execution.  The construction of automatic fact checking for politics could have a fascinating impact</li>
<li><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html">Stevey's Blog Rants: Portrait of a N00b</a> - An oldie but a goodie. I disagree with Steve&#039;s point here about this being about maturity of developer, since I&#039;ve met some otherwise battle-scared and mature developer who have never seen enlightenment.  I think it&#039;s probably closer to the difference between a journeyman and a master.</li>
<li><a href="http://rlstollar.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/applebees-overnight-social-media-meltdown-a-photo-essay/">Applebee&rsquo;s Overnight Social Media Meltdown: A Photo Essay | R.L. Stollar</a> - I think this will be in the social media guidebook on how not to handle a pr issue.</li>
