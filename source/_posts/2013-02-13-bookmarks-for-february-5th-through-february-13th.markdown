<p>Things from around the web, as seen on February 5th through February 13th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://badassjs.com/post/40691367335/voxel-js-a-minecraft-like-block-based-game-engine">Voxel.js: A Minecraft-like Block Based Game Engine Using Three.js, WebGL and Node</a> - This looks quite cool.  I hope that it goes beyond a tech demo to a real game at some point.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.david-jensen.com/development/why-metro-chose-wordpress-vip-cms/">Why Metro chose WordPress VIP as their CMS and front end</a> - Everytime I suggest that Wordpress wouldn&#039;t make a bad CMS for a newspaper I get shouted down by technologists who hate PHP or Wordpress.  It looks like it&#039;s working pretty well for the Metro.</li>
<li><a href="http://sachagreif.com/flat-pixels/">Flat Pixels: The Battle Between Flat Design And Skeuomorphism</a> - Skeuomorph or flat? A nice, well thought out article explaining the move to flat designs in a way that even someone as design deficient as myself can understand.</li>
<li><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323375204578269991660836834.html?mod=WSJ_hp_EditorsPicks">It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being 'It' - WSJ.com</a> - This makes me happy. There should be more childish games in life.</li>
</ul>
