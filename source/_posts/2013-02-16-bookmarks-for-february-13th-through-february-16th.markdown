<p>Things from around the web, as seen on February 13th through February 16th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/186171/making_the_move_to_html5_part_1.php?print=1">Making the Move to HTML5, Part 1 - Gamasutra</a> - HTML+Javascript from a professional gamedev viewpoint.</li>
<li><a href="http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/">Markdown.css - make HTML look like plain-text</a> - This is... I&#039;m not entirely sure what this is.  It&#039;s pretty cool, I&#039;m just not sure why.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/02/ideas-bank/the-secret-to-getting-more-women-into-tech">Caroline Drucker: The secret to getting more women into tech</a> - Stop calling women girls.  I&#039;m not sure that everybody who calls women girls is doing so in order to maintain the patriarchy, often times it might just be for the Alliteration of Geek and Girls.  But there are a lot of valid points there, Girl does imply youth and a lack of respect.  So lets start calling women by their titles, say Developer, Architect or Designer, and if we have to refer to the gender lets call them Women</li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/blog/email-transparency">Email transparency</a> - Communication within a company is hard, really hard.  It looks like stripe are trying to make it possible to dip in and out of conversations in a really easy way.</li>
</ul>
