<p>Things from around the web, as seen on February 24th through May 16th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2013/05/15/http_problem">mnot&rsquo;s blog: Indicating Problems in HTTP APIs</a> - Interesting take on trying to standardise HTTP error conditions</li>
<li><a href="http://zenhabits.net/creative-habit/">the most important creative habits? solitude and participation.</a> - </li>
<li><a href="http://rrees.me/2013/02/24/guardian-may-2013-hackday/">Guardian May 2013 Hackday | Echo One</a> - A good summary from our most prolific hacker at the recent hack day.<br />
Interesting to note that Roberts strength came from working alone rather than as a group. My advice to teams was to work in groups where possible, since we found in the past that solo developers often aim too high and don&#039;t achieve anything.</li>
</ul>
