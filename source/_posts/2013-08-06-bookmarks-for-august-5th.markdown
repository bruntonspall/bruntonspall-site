<p>Things from around the web, as seen on August 5th</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/geek-empire-1/a1ebd2b4a0e5">The Ecuadorian Library &mdash; Geek Empire &mdash; Medium</a> - Excellent and insightful discussion of the Assange, NSA, Snowden, Wikileaks debacle.</li>
<li><a href="http://coreos.com/">CoreOS - Minimalist OS for servers</a> - Linux has a bloat problem, and with the rise of LXC style technologies, the desire to have much simpler smaller OS images is increasing.<br />
CoreOS attempts to do one thing, run containers, and do it well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker, The linux container engine</a> - Using LXC to host process isolated containers means that you can host or run multiple applications on your server with the security benefits that cloud platforms gives you.<br />
Additionally it makes deployment, upgrading and monitoring much easier, and encourages the Immutable server pattern</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/07/30/introducing-minion/">Introducing Minion - An automated security testing tool</a> - We&#039;ve done unit tests, integration tests, UAT and even browser testing, but this is the first decent automated security testing framework that I&#039;ve seen put together.<br />
Consider me highly impressed.</li>
<li><a href="http://qubes-os.org/trac">Qubes - A secure separation of concerns desktop OS</a> - Qubes is very early in it&#039;s lifecycle, but I like the idea that you can run multiple containers side by side, enabling you to use a much more secure and locked down desktop for work stuff as well as a less secure personal desktop.  It&#039;ll never be as secure as a dedicated machine, but given that I&#039;ve now experienced the pain of attempting to use a secure computer, this is a good step forward.</li>
</ul>
